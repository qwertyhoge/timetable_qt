# Timetable Application With Qt
This timetable is a self-management tool that will be based on character interface.
This application comes from attemping to avoid the limit of self-management as breaking any plans that we made by ourselves.
I am approaching self-management completion with letting other person manage our plans and I chose to use characters as that person.
This way even you do not have any friends can drive yourself... maybe.
